# SimpleMatchmaker

A very simple barebones server/client that allows users to find other players to start 2 player p2p games. No authentication.

Server - run it passing a port as argument.

If you forward ports, you can run it on your computer and it will be reachable to the wider internet, otherwise run it on a publically available server. 
Or just run it locally for testing.

Client - simple command example app for using the ServerConnection object and connecting to and interacting with the server, then making a 
connection to a another peer.
